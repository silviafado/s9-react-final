# CAPSTONE: Art & Culture App

# Description

The aim of the project is to create a Cultural App to search visual content using React and API calls to request asynchronously user data to dynamically update the UI.


# Project Instructions

The goal of this project:
- Create at least 5 components.
- Use the React routes.
- Use Redux or Context.
- Consume at least 1 external API.
- Use services to implement business logic for called APIs.
- Implement login / registration with localStorage.
- Protect routes, either because there is an admin user who can only see a part of it, or because there are normal and premium users.
- Customised layout with responsive design.
- The solution must be bug-free, and the mentor can make a complete user flow (a specific action, if for example it is an e-commerce, would be to make the entire purchase process, from the web to which goes to payment).
